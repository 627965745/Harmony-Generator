# Harmony-Generator

## Abstract
The word music is familiar to everyone. Beautiful and harmonious sounds are considered music. Behind the production of all sounds is the result of a series of mathematical permutations. The reason why it sounds harmonious and beautiful also contains certain mathematical laws. A melody alone is not enough to make a good impression, an appropriated harmony or chord has to accompany with. Therefore, we can re-disassemble the two and recombine them to explore the possibility of new elements and new opportunities.

This project is to research that is there a connection between music elements that are also strongly related to mathematics and data-based AI technology, which can produce innovative changes that are different from previous cognition? Here we are to present approaches that using Neural Network and machine learning techniques, with training data of the large size of MIDI files, a program aims to learn and generate harmonic output for any melody.

Since music is a subjective artwork, the composed score is played to participants where they are expected to fill a questionnaire about various aspects of the music according to their personal feelings. In the final test and evaluation stage of this project, the feedback from the questionnaire contributes mostly to this stage of this project.

## Introduction
Artificial Neural Networks are the core of machine learning and deep learning. As the name suggests, it is a concept that can be said to be bionics. We found that the cooperation between neurons can complete the processing and transmission of information, so the concept of the artificial neural network is proposed for information processing and has been successful in many applications such as Speech Recognition and Image Generation.

In this project, we build a Python program that generates harmony for a music melody using Artificial Neural Networks. A melody alone cannot show off the beauty of music. It is undeniable that the performance of musical symphonies and concertos can be spectacular, and the reason behind this is the sound of various instruments harmonious with each other. Successful application of neural networks can help solo instrument players to compose more pleasant music, as one of the goals of this project.

In this document, we will elaborate on the following details of this project:
- Starting with a literature review of related works which have been done in the field of machine learning, including comparisons between different machine learning algorithms. Additionally, some music theory studies and Python libraries and datasets are available to help us build the program more easily.
- Methodology that has been adopted from studies and how the program has been implemented, the details of the implementation are elaborated in this chapter.
- Analysis and evaluation chapter explains the output of the program and the tests done to the program. Testing is done by a survey, including listening to the output audio.
After reading this report, one will see how an audio file is processed, the performance of a recurrent neural network of composing music, limitations and possible future improvements.
