# Harmony-Generator
The word music is familiar to everyone. Beautiful and harmonious sounds are considered music. Behind the production of all sounds is the result of a series of mathematical permutations. The reason why it sounds harmonious and beautiful also contains certain mathematical laws. A melody alone is not enough to make a good impression, an appropriated harmony or chord has to accompany with. Therefore, we can re-disassemble the two and recombine them to explore the possibility of new elements and new opportunities.
This project is to research that is there a connection between music elements that are also strongly related to mathematics and data-based AI technology, which can produce innovative changes that are different from previous cognition? Here we are to present approaches that using Neural Network and machine learning techniques, with training data of the large size of MIDI files, a program aims to learn and generate harmonic output for any melody.
Since music is a subjective artwork, the composed score is played to participants where they are expected to fill a questionnaire about various aspects of the music according to their personal feelings. In the final test and evaluation stage of this project, the feedback from the questionnaire contributes mostly to this stage of this project.
